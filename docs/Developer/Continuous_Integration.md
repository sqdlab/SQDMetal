# Continuous Integration

NOTE: When testing this out on GitHub, as it is unpredictable, MAKE SURE TO USE ANOTHER BRANCH AND THEN MERGE WHEN IT IS WORKING.

Considerations with Windows:
- Use Powershell commands
- Don't use backslash as that is an operator in Powershell
- Currently the shell will not activate/init properly. Thus, the python location is hard-coded - e.g. `C:/Miniconda3/envs/sqdmetal_env/python.exe`. This needs to be changed in the future
